# CARTRIDGE_METHACRYLATE_FLASHJACKS

This methacrylate cartridge is specially designed for the FLASHJACKS PCB designer for Antonio. It has all the custom cutouts for the SD slot, audio jack output and input, x2 leds, and mini HDMI for programming. It also incorporates the STL file to print in 3D the separators that close the cartridge. You have to superglue the back of the cartridge with the sides and top of the casing
